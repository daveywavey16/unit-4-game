<!--
Instructions:
Add in the missing code such that clicking any of the sandwiches causes…
An alert message to popup saying something snarky about the sandwich type.
A second alert message that displays to the user the number of that specific sandwich they’ve eaten.
HINT: You will need counter variables.
BONUS: Add an image to the image-div on the click event.
